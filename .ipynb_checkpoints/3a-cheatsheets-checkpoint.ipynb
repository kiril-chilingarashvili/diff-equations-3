    "### You've been put in charge of part of a medicine manufacturing plant with three identical cylindrical storage tanks. These tanks are filled with the medicine to different heights and are connected to each other via a pipe at their bottoms, with valves that are initially closed. Our goal is to determine how the fluid will flow once we open the valves. Note that we have solved the analogous problem for two tanks in the course Differential equations: 2 by 2 systems previously.\n",

    "\n",
    "### We will make the simplifying assumptions that we can model the flow linearly, and that the flow rate is proportional to the difference in fluid height (as in the case with only 2 tanks). These assumptions are valid when the pipes have a small diameter relative to the overall size of the tanks, the geometry of the pipes and tanks is simple, and the fluid properties of the medicine work out.\n",

    "### ***Equation for tank 1:***\n",
    "### Let us first work out the differential equation describing fluid flow into tank 1. Let $V_1$ be the volume of fluid in tank 1. The flow rate of fluid into (or out of) tank 1 is by definition $\\frac{dV_1}{dt}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### As mentioned above, we assume that the flow rate is proportional to the difference in heights. The flow rate into tank 1 from tank 2 is $b(h_2-h_1)$ where $b$ is the constant of proportionality (with dimension $[length]^2[time]^{-1}$). Similarly, the flow rate from tank 3 is $c(h_3-h_1)$ with $c$ the constant of proportionality. The flow rate into tank 1 is therefore:\n",
    "## $$ \\frac{dV_1}{dt} = b(h_2-h_1)+c(h_3-h_1) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note that the constant $b$ is positive because when $h_2>h_1$ fluid flows into tank 1 so that $V_1$ is increasing. Similarly, $c$ is positive. We usually set up differential equations so that parameters such as $b$ and $c$ are positive. This way we will be less prone to sign errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Since the tank is cylindrical, the rate of change in volume $V_1$ is given by the cross sectional area $A$ times the rate of change in height $h_1$ of fluid in tank 1:\n",

Let $a_{21} = \\frac{b}{A}$ (with dimension $[time]^{-1}$), where the subscript $21$ indicates that this is the constant governing the flow from tank 2 to tank 1. Similarly, let $a_{31} = \\frac{c}{A}$ be the combined constant governing flow from tank 3 and tank 1. The differential equation in terms of the new constants is:\n",

    "### Note that $a_{12} = a_{21}$. For example, if $h_2>h_1$ then $a_{21}(h_2-h_1) > 0$ so the flow rate from tank 2 into tank 1 is positive, whereas $a_{12}(h_1 - h_2) < 0$ so that the flow rate from tank 1 to tank 2 is negative.

By the existence and uniqueness theorem, these must be equal, implying $c_1\\bf{x_1}(t) + c_2 \\bf{x_2}(t) + \\ldots + c_n\\bf{x_n}(t) = 0$. This contradicts the original assumption that $\\bf{x_1}(t), \\ldots,\\bf{x_n}(t)$ are linearly independent."
